    "question": "While making a reconnaissance survey through the woods, a surveyor with a hand compass, started from a point A and walked a thousand steps in the direction S67°W and reached a point B. Then he changed his direction and walked 512 steps in the direction N10°E and reached a point C. Then again he changed his direction and walked 1504 steps in the direction S65°E and reached a point D as shown in Fig. 5.10. Now, the surveyor wants to return to the starting point A. In which direction should he move and how many steps should he take.<image 1>",
